## Introduction

Made as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on FreeCodeCamp.

### Course Aim

Convert the given number into a roman numeral.

All roman numerals answers should be provided in upper-case.


### Personal Aims

Succesfully solve the JavaScript challenge.

Convert the code from my completed challenge so that it works with a HTML page.

Improve my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript.

Have a project I can go back and refactor as I progress, for shorter code that's easier to understand.


## Technologies

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- CSS3

## Launch

Running this project locally should be nice and easy! Either download the repository from Github or use the viewer on Codepen.

### Prerequisites

None

### Running

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the repo file, simply open up the index.html in your browser.


## Built With

- Visual Studio Code

- Chrome Devtools

- FCC Console

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

I developed the JS code in on FCC for the challenge, then used VSC to amend it and add it to HTML.

### [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
I've found myself using multiple learning resources for JavaScript and this has been a very useful one.

A brilliant resource to assist with learning to code.

### [WebAIM.org](https://webaim.org/)
Their colour contrast checker is a go to for me every time so I can ensure my work is readable.

### [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)
I use their 'create a palette' tool to help me select a colour scheme.


## Author Notes

My initial effort at this code worked but was very long winded and not great to read. I've since refactored it, following a different appraoch and it's much better now in my opinion.

It was great to be able to go back to a task like this and go again with a greater understanding of JavaScript. I feel I still have a ways to go with my learning (there's always improvement you can make) but I know I'm progressing an that feels great!
