## Introduction

Made as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on FreeCodeCamp.

### Course Aim

Convert the given number into a roman numeral.

All roman numerals answers should be provided in upper-case.


### Personal Aims

Succesfully solve the JavaScript challenge.

Convert the code from my completed challenge so that it works with a HTML page.

Improve my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript.

Have a project I can go back and refactor as I progress, for shorter code that's easier to understand.


## Technologies

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- CSS3

## Launch

Running this project locally should be nice and easy! Either download the repository from Github or use the viewer on Codepen.

### Prerequisites

None

### Running

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the repo file, simply open up the index.html in your browser.


## Built With

- Visual Studio Code

- Chrome Devtools

- FCC Console

I developed the JS code in on FCC for the challenge, then used VSC to amend it and add it to HTML.

Their colour contrast checker is a go to for me every time so I can ensure my work is readable.

I use their 'create a palette' tool to help me select a colour scheme.


## Author Notes

I'll be honest, my my inital JS code for this task is horrendous. It works, but it's long and I repeat myself a lot. I'm also not convinced it's particularly easy to understand either, I can certainly improve that too. I'll definitely be taking some time to refactor the code in the near future.

On the plus side, producing code like this now means it should be easy to display my progression as I complete other challenges and also go back to refactor this code. I'm excited to get practicing refining my code as it's not something I've done much of yet.

It's also been another good practice of developing algorithms to solve problems. So far this has been the area I've struggled with the most I think, which is bad as it's really important, so practice and progress will be key. I did solve the problem though, it may have been in a rather drawn out way but it still worked, I'll only keep getting better!
